# Cornell Conversational Analysis Toolkit ([ConvoKit](http://convokit.cornell.edu/))
This toolkit contains tools to extract conversational features and analyze social phenomena in conversations, using a [single unified interface](https://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/documentation/architecture.html) inspired by (and compatible with) scikit-learn.  Several large [conversational datasets](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit#datasets) are included together with scripts exemplifying the use of the toolkit on these datasets. The latest version is [2.1.12](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/releases/tag/v2.0) (released 21 Oct 2019).

The toolkit currently implements features for:

### [Linguistic coordination](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Echoes_of_power.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/documentation/coordination.html)</sup></sub>

A measure of linguistic influence (and relative power) between individuals or groups based on their use of function words.  
Example: [exploring the balance of power in the U.S. Supreme Court](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/coordination/examples.ipynb).

### [Politeness strategies](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Politeness.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/documentation/politenessStrategies.html)</sup></sub>

A set of lexical and parse-based features correlating with politeness and impoliteness.  
Example: [understanding the (mis)use of politeness strategies in conversations gone awry on Wikipedia](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/conversations-gone-awry/Conversations_Gone_Awry_Prediction.ipynb).

### [Conversational prompts](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Asking_too_much.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/documentation/questionTypology.html)</sup></sub>

An unsupervised method for extracting surface motifs that occur in conversations and grouping them by rhetorical role.  
Examples: [extracting common question types in U.K. parliament](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/question-typology/parliament_questions_example.ipynb), [understanding the use of conversational prompts in conversations gone awry on Wikipedia](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/conversations-gone-awry/Conversations_Gone_Awry_Prediction.ipynb).

### [Hypergraph conversation representation](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Patterns_of_participant_interactions.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/documentation/hyperconvo.html)</sup></sub>
A method for extracting structural features of conversations through a hypergraph representation.  
Example: [hypergraph creation and feature extraction, visualization and interpretation on a subsample of Reddit](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/hyperconvo/demo.ipynb).

### [Linguistic diversity in conversations](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Finding_your_voice__linguistic_development.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/documentation/userConvoDiversity.html)</sup></sub>
A method to compute the linguistic diversity of individuals within their own conversations, and between other individuals in a population.  
Example: [user conversation attributes and diversity example on ChangeMyView](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/examples/user-convo-attributes/user-convo-diversity-demo.ipynb)

### [CRAFT: Online forecasting of conversational outcomes (Coming Soon!)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01362)
A neural model for forecasting future outcomes of conversations (e.g., derailment into personal attacks) as they develop.  
The ConvoKit CRAFT API is still under development, but in the meantime an ad-hoc implementation using ConvoKit data can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GvICZN0VwZQSWw3pJaEVY-EQGoO-L5lH).

## Datasets
ConvoKit ships with several datasets ready for use "out-of-the-box".
These datasets can be downloaded using the `convokit.download()` [helper function](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/convokit/util.py).  Alternatively you can access them directly [here](http://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/datasets/).

### [Conversations Gone Awry Dataset](https://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/convokit/documentation/awry.html)

Two related corpora of conversations that derail into antisocial behavior. One corpus consists of Wikipedia talk page conversations that derail into personal attacks as labeled by crowdworkers (4,188 conversations containing 30.021 comments). The other consists of discussion threads on the subreddit ChangeMyView (CMV) that derail into rule-violating behavior as determined by the presence of a moderator intervention (6,842 conversations containing 42,964 comments).  
Name for download: `conversations-gone-awry-corpus` (Wikipedia version) or `conversations-gone-awry-cmv-corpus` (Reddit CMV version)
